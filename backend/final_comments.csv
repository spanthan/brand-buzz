I'm thrilled to receive such a wonderful review from you!,positive
"Unfortunately, CeraVe is not cruelty-free.",negative
It's a water-based cleanser; I got it yesterday. I thought it was a cleansing oil.,positive
America not having the good stuff is so annoying! I need this too.,negative
It’s better to use a second cleanser.,positive
My oily skin is itchy.,negative
"I don't know why many of my CeraVe cleansers say it's a soap. If I read the label in French, it says ""crème."" And it doesn't foam, but they tell me it's supposed to.",negative
"I only use balms to remove my makeup; Clinique is good, but expensive; the Soap & Glory one is great.",positive
"We have this in Australia! Not designed to be used as a makeup remover, but it does a good job of removing it anyway.",positive
"I definitely prefer this over the CeraVe Foaming Cleaner; FYI, that one burned my eyes.",positive
"Actually, I've been using this for forever, and it does foam up quite a bit; you just need some more water.",positive
"I think it would be fine in a double cleanse if all you use is sunscreen, but anything with any tint isn't the best option.",positive
Mine does foam up when you need to add more water than just damp skin for it to foam though.,negative
Rub it together with water in your hands first; it actually foams up a bit and works better.,positive
It's water-based.,positive
I can't believe we've had it in Australia for so long before the US. Glad you like it!,positive
I don't really know why they won't make this available in the US! Thanks for the demo.,positive
"Wait, what? I've been using it with water; I've been using it all wrong.",negative
You have to fluff it up in your hands.,negative
"You put it on, and you add water; then it foams, which is why they say ""damp skin.",negative
"I have the cream to foam, and I love it! I add water to my cleanser to make it foam better.",positive
I've got this; it's perfect.,positive
I'm curious about the new Isdin Oil Cleanser.,positive
You are naturally quite pretty.,positive
It's now here in the US! Yay!,positive
This product is like a cleansing oil.,positive
They are conducting animal tests.,negative
I use it with a muslin cloth and find that it foams up much more with that.,positive
That looks like it will take off lashes with extensions.,positive
"Ugh, I have eczema and combination skin; CeraVe products either dry me out or make me feel sticky. I hate it.",negative
"It is within us that I have it, and you can find it at Target, Walmart, Amazon, etc.",positive
We need a waterproof mascara test!,positive
Please note that the amount of micellar waters has been sold out everywhere.,negative
We love ceramides and believe it's essential to incorporate them into our skin care routine. We also insist on using skincare products that are gentle on our skin.,positive
"I bought it to take with me on vacation because I hoped I wouldn't need anything else, and so I'm happy with this.",positive
"Hi, what do you think of the CeraVe moisturizer? I want a really good one, and I was wondering if it's worth it.",positive
"Wow, it looks good early!",positive
"It's on us now! Run to Ulta, guys!",positive
You're supposed to rub it between your hands to make it foam up.,negative
I could see this as my morning cleanser; it looks really mild.,positive
"We need this in the United States, please!",positive
"Wait, America doesn't have CeraVe.",negative
You should try it.,positive
You need to first take water onto your face and then do the cleanse I got today!,positive
"It foams if you use it on clean skin; I mean, with no makeup on.",positive
The cat needs skin care for its future.,negative
CeraVe is toxic. Why does everyone keep suggesting it? We need to demand better from these companies.,negative
You're supposed to emulsify it in your hands before applying it to your face.,negative
It foams on me.,negative
"Hey everyone, we sell cool, trendy jewelry at an affordable price, and I would really appreciate it if you could support my small business.",positive
"The name may be a bit confusing, but it's a water-based cleanser that requires water to create foam; simply put, it's a water-based cleanser.",negative
"Wow, you don't even need makeup! It looks like you're wearing it even when it's all washed off!",positive
"Your face and hands are supposed to be wet, and then you kind of rub it into your hands, and it gets foamy.",negative
"Certainly, not everyone agrees with tests on animals.",negative
CeraVe is not cruelty-free.,negative

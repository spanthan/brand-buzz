I am extremely honored to receive this great review from you!
"Unfortunately, CeraVe is not cruelty-free."
"It's a water-based cleanser; I got it yesterday, thinking it was a cleansing oil."
America not having the good stuff is so annoying! I need that!
It's better to use a second cleanser.
My oily skin is screaming.
"I don't know why many of my CeraVe cleansers say it's a soap, and if I read the ingredient list in French, it says ""cr√®me."" It doesn't foam, but they tell me it's a cleanser."
"I only use balms to remove my makeup; Clinique is good, but expensive. The Soap & Glory one is great."
"We have this in Australia! Not designed to be used as a makeup remover, but it does a good job of it anyway."
"I definitely prefer this over the CeraVe foaming cleaner; FYI, that one burns my eyes."
"Actually, I've been using this product for a very long time, and it does foam up quite a bit; all you need is a bit more water."
"I think it would be fine in a double cleanse if all you use is sunscreen, but anything with any tint isn't the best option."
Mine does foam up when you need to add more water than just damp skin for it to foam though.
Rub it together with water in your hands first; it does actually foam up a bit and work better.
It's water-based.
I can't believe we've had it in Australia for so long before it's popular in the US. Glad you like it!
I don't really know why they won't make this available in the US! Thanks for the demo.
"Wait, I've been using it with water; I've been using it all wrong."
You have to foam it up in your hand.
"You put it on, add water, and it foams; that's why they say damp skin doesn't help."
"I have a cream that I foam and really enjoy it! To enhance the texture, I add water to my cleanser to create foam."
I've got this; it's perfect.
I'm curious about the new Isdin Oil Cleanser.
You are naturally very beautiful.
It's now here in the US! Yay!
This product is similar to a cleansing oil.
They are conducting animal tests.
I use it with a muslin cloth and find it foams up a lot less with that.
That looks like it will take off lash extensions.
"Ugh, I have eczema and combination skin; CeraVe products either dry me out or make me feel sticky. I hate it."
"It's in us that I have it, and you can find it at Target, Walmart, Amazon, etc."
We need a waterproof mascara test!
Please correct that the amount of micellar waters has been sold out everywhere.
We love ceramides and must include this in our skin-care routine. We must use skin care that is gentle on our skin.
"I bought it to take with me on vacation because I hoped I wouldn't need anything else, so I'm happy with this."
"Hi, what do you think of CeraVe moisturizer? I'm looking for a really good one and was wondering if it's worth it."
"Wow, it looks good early."
"It's time for us now! Run to Ulta, guys!"
You're supposed to rub it between your hands to make it foam up.
I could see this as my morning cleanser; it looks really mild.
"We need this in the U.S., please!"
"Wait, America doesn't have CeraVe."
You should try this.
"You need to first take some water and apply it to your face, then do the cleanse I got today!"
"It foams if you use it on clean skin, meaning that there is no makeup involved."
The cat needs proper skin care for its future.
CeraVe is toxic. Why does everyone keep suggesting it? We need to demand better from these companies.
You're supposed to emulsify it in your hands before applying it to your face.
It foams on me.
"Hey everyone, we sell cool, trendy jewelry for an affordable price, and I would really appreciate it if you were to support my small business."
"The product is a water-based cleanser; its name may be confusing, but it requires using water to create lather."
"Wow, you don't even need makeup! It looks like you're wearing it, even when it's all washed off!"
"Your face and hands are supposed to be wet, and then you kind of rub it into your hands and it gets foamy."
"Certainly, they test on animals."
CeraVe is not cruelty-free.
"It's not cruelty-free! Oh, you did the eye test? What about all the animals that were tested!!!!!"
"This is $17 on CareToBeauty, and they ship to the US."
They test on animals.

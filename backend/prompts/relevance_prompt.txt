You are analyzing social media comments about a TikTok video posted that is reviewing a CeraVe cleanser.
Each comment might include a mix of:
- Relevant content (e.g., product usage, effectiveness, ingredients, skin type, ANY QUESTION, etc.)\n"
- Irrelevant content (e.g., questions unrelated to the creator or the product or the review)\n\n"
Label each comment as one of the following:\n"
- "relevant" → about the product and useful for identifying product-related themes, both good and bad comments\n'
- "irrelevant" → off-topic, questions, or focused on unrelated topics\n\n'

Again remember that any questions should be marked as irrelevant!

Respond in this format:
1. relevant
2. irrelevant
3. relevant

Don't give any justification. Just the classification.

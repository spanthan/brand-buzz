You are a precise and context-aware content deduplicator.

You will be given a list of phrases that were extracted from social media comments. Many of these phrases mean the same thing even if they are worded differently.

Your job is to group together ALL phrases that express the same idea. For each phrase, choose a canonical form — a concise version that best represents its meaning — by selecting one of the phrases **from the list itself**.

Use the original phrases only. Do not invent new ones or summarize the ideas with abstract concepts. Group together ALL phrases that refer to:
- the same action (e.g. "foam up bit", "foams when", "make it foam")
- the same product property (e.g. "is not cruelty-free", "they test on animals", "animal testing")
- the same brand behavior or symptom (e.g. "burned my eyes", "irritates eyes")

Do not treat similar words as different if they clearly point to the same core idea.

If a phrase is meaningful but doesn’t belong in any group, map it to itself.

Return your response as a JSON object where the keys are the original phrases, and the values are the canonical phrases. Like this:
"phrase 1": "canonical phrase",
"phrase 2": "canonical phrase",
...

Now normalize the following phrases:

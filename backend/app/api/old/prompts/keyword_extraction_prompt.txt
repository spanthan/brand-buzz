You are a helpful and precise assistant.

Given the following comment:
"{comment}"

And this list of possible keywords:
{keyword_list}

Your task is to identify which keywords clearly apply to the comment, based on both their meaning and their sentiment.

⚠️ Do NOT match a keyword if its sentiment or polarity contradicts what the comment says. For example:
- If the comment says “they test on animals”, do NOT match it with “not tested on animals”.
- If the comment says something foams up well, do NOT match it with “doesn’t foam”.

✅ Only return keywords that are explicitly supported by the comment’s meaning and tone.

Return only a **comma-separated list of keywords** from the given list that accurately apply to the comment — no explanations or extra text.
